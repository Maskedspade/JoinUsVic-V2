          Hey! It's Lindsey and Yuhan! Great to see you here <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">ðŸ˜ƒ</span>. <br/>We just wanted to let you know that this 3D model of Victoria is by no means the latest update or the most precise, but it is certainly a master piece by Yuhan during her architecture studies.
          <br/>We made this web app to showcase some of the fun places to do fun things, coming from us - the two people that don't go out all that much <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">ðŸ¤¯</span>.
          <br/>So please don't take us seriously, but still enjoy the super fun interactive 3D model. Hopefully you can learn a thing or two even when the model is completely outdated later on *cough*
